# Communications
Communications protocols for passing information between the modules in the Hyperloop pod

## LCM (Lightweight Communications and Marshalling)
Set of libraries and tools for passing messages and marshalling data, in systems where high-bandwidth and low latency is essential.

### Benefits of LCM
* Simple C-like syntax that allows for sending packets of information


### Supported Platforms
* Platforms
    * GNU/Linux
    * OS X
    * Windows
