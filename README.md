## Semester Goals


This Semester we hoped to work with the Hardware team to obtain, read and centralize sensor data In addition to sensor and Arduino work, we hoped to develop a graphical user interface that the entire team can use to view and monitor sensors in the pod. However, because of Covid-19 we are unable to meet in person and have shifted our focus to creating a comprehensive FDR for the Hyperloop Competition.
