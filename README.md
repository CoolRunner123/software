## Semester Goals


This semester we will work more closely with Hardware, connecting the sensors and arduinos to the Odroid C2, and developing the communications protocol to integrate everything from the sensors to the pilot computer, which will be running the GUI. We want to create a working GUI that will have most of the functionality, including interfacing with the Odroid/sensor setup and being able to graph live data coming from the hardware.
