## Semester Goals
<!---This Semester our goal is to work with the Hardware team to obtain, read and centralize sensor data. We are working with Arduinos and an Odriod C2. In addition to sensor and Arduino work, we are developing a graphical user interface that the entire team can use to view and monitor sensors in the pod.
